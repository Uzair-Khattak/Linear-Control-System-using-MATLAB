Hello everyone , In this code , I have made a simple a program which calculates the value of pole of a unity feedback transfer function for a given value of zeta and given transfer function.
In the inputs just need to provide the zeros and poles of the system with required value of zeta.
Function will return :
value of pole for given zeta .
value of gain
plot of rootlocus and zetaline , (their intersection)
